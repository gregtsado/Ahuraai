## "Revamping Lagos E-Hailing Regulations: Stakeholders Demand a Comprehensive Review"

The e-hailing industry has been a game-changer in the transportation sector, providing convenient and efficient services to millions of people in Lagos, Nigeria. However, recent regulations imposed by the Lagos State Government have caused a stir among stakeholders, with many calling for a comprehensive review.

In August 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced new regulations for e-hailing companies operating in the state. These regulations include a 10% service tax on every trip, a N25 million ($61,000) license fee for operators, and a N10 million ($24,000) annual renewal fee. The government also mandated that all e-hailing drivers must undergo a background check and obtain a driver's badge from the Lagos State Drivers' Institute.

While the government claims that these regulations are necessary for safety and revenue generation, stakeholders in the e-hailing industry have raised concerns about the practicality and impact of these regulations.

One of the major concerns is the high cost of compliance for e-hailing companies. The N25 million license fee and N10 million annual renewal fee are seen as exorbitant and could potentially drive smaller players out of the market. This could lead to a monopoly in the industry, which could result in higher prices for consumers.

Another issue is the 10% service tax, which is seen as an additional burden on both the e-hailing companies and the drivers. This tax could potentially lead to a decrease in earnings for drivers, who are already struggling to make ends meet due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, the background check and driver's badge requirements have been criticized for being time-consuming and costly. Many drivers have complained about the lengthy process and the high fees involved, which could further reduce their earnings.

In light of these concerns, stakeholders in the e-hailing industry are calling for a comprehensive review of the regulations. They argue that the government should engage with all relevant parties, including e-hailing companies, drivers, and consumers, to come up with regulations that are fair and practical for all stakeholders.

Some have suggested that the government should consider a tiered licensing system, where smaller players pay a lower fee, while larger companies pay a higher fee. This could promote healthy competition and prevent a monopoly in the industry.

Others have proposed that the service tax should be reduced or scrapped altogether, as it could discourage people from using e-hailing services and lead to a decline in revenue for the government.

It is also important for the government to address the issue of safety without burdening the drivers and companies with excessive fees and requirements. Instead, they could work with e-hailing companies to implement safety measures such as driver training and vehicle inspections.

In conclusion, the e-hailing industry has been a significant contributor to the economy of Lagos, providing employment opportunities and convenient transportation services. However, the recent regulations have caused uncertainty and dissatisfaction among stakeholders. It is crucial for the government to listen to the concerns of all parties and conduct a comprehensive review of the regulations to ensure a fair and sustainable e-hailing industry in Lagos.
